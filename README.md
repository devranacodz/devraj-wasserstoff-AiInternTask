Building an AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis Using Pixellib in Python
The code demonstrates the use of Pixellib, a Python library that simplifies image segmentation tasks using pre-trained deep learning models. This AI pipeline can identify objects within an image, outline them, and optionally display bounding boxes.

Library and Model Initialization: The code imports the instance_segmentation class from Pixellib and loads a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model (mask_rcnn_coco.h5), which has been trained on the COCO dataset. This model is capable of detecting and segmenting various objects in an image.

Segmentation Process: The method segmentImage() is applied to an input image (cycle.jpg). This function analyzes the image and segments the detected objects, drawing bounding boxes around them if show_bboxes=True is specified.

Output: The segmented image is saved as output.jpg, with objects labeled and optionally enclosed in bounding boxes for further analysis or visualization.

This AI pipeline can be extended to more complex applications, such as object detection, instance segmentation, or advanced object analytics.
